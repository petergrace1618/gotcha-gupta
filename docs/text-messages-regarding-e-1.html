"Hey yâ€™all keep your eyes out for this guy around the bar, 
His name is Ethan Lindsey, he has a Utah id.

He is gyps (our newer cooks) abusive ex.
Iâ€™m not sure the whole story but heâ€™s been in town from Utah and is stalking her. 
From what sheâ€™s told me she has a restraining order on him in Utah but Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s active? 
I told him heâ€™s 86â€™d and that heâ€™s not welcome at the bar. When I told him to leave he made fists at his sides stared me down, he seems unhinged or on something judging by his very dilated eyes. Gyps seemed pretty shaken up about it ðŸ˜¢

Here is a picture of him she sent me, heâ€™s a bit more scruffy now than in this picture"<br>

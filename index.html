  <p>
    On Saturday November 2 2024, my girlfriend at the time, Amanda Melissa Ruiz, aka &ldquo;Gyps,&rdquo; said she gave away some of my stuff. 
  </p>
  <p>
    On Monday November 4, some of my most valuable possessions were missing: three guitars, a guitar amp, my comic book collection, two guitar stands, a collection of Crown Royal bags, and a bag of kitchen utensils. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After the fact, I learned that she slandered me and apparently continues to slander me, I discovered recently.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, I'm writing this for the following reasons.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First and foremost, to refute her slander and other false claims;
    </li>
    <li>
      To serve as a warning to her present or future associates regarding her manipulative behavior; and
    </li>
    <li>
      Lastly, for my own benefit&ndash;that is, for catharsis.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Now, to begin.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think it's fair to say that most people tell the truth and assume that most others do too. So, when someone hears a sob story from a charming, charismatic, and pretty girl about her "psycho" or "abusive" ex-boyfriend, people are inclined to believe it. Without evidence to the contrary, that is. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, here's some evidence to the contrary.
  </p>
  <h2> Her Claims </h2>

  <!-- Claim No. 1 -->

  <details>
    <summary class="claim">Claim No. 1: She sued me in small claims court</summary>
    <article>
    <p>
      This is the easiest to refute, making it also laughably absurd, because anyone can fact-check this using the <a href="https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/Home/Dashboard/29" target="_blank">Oregon Judicial Department &ndash; Online Records Search</a>. A search for &ldquo;Ruiz, Amanda Gyps&rdquo; shows only one small claims case where she's the defendant. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I found out she said this the same day <a href="docs/notice-of-entry-of-judgment/" target="_blank">the default judgment</a> was entered against her. Ironic for her, humorously coincidental for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also filed a police report because of the events of November 2 to 4 stated above. I paid her rent in September and October; I don't think I deserved what she did to me. Hereinafter, I'll refer to these events as &ldquo;the incident&rdquo; and to her as &ldquo;G&rdquo;. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a detailed account see <a href="docs/declaration-of-peter-grace/" target="_blank">Declaration of Peter Grace</a>. Here is a synopsis.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was tired of the roller coaster that our relationship had become, so I contacted an old friend, Leslie. I explained my situation. She happened to have a room open, and said I could move in if I wanted. Leslie isn't the tidiest person in the world, so I told her that I would want to clean the place before I moved in. Several times In October, I went to Leslie's to do so. Meanwhile, I was still on the fence about moving out. I wanted to make sure that I was making the right decision for all parties concerned which were G, me, our roommate Adam, and Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday November 2, the day of the incident, I went to Leslie's again to clean. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a timeline of that night.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I arrive at Leslie's and meet her friend Matty for the first time.
      </li>
      <li>
        G calls me shortly after I arrive. I tell her that I'm going to spend the night at Leslie's and will be back tomorrow. 
      </li>
      <li>
        A couple hours later, she calls me again and threatens to throw my stuff out. I tell her more than once not to do it. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I immediately call our roommate, Adam. I tell him she's threatening to throw my stuff out, and ask if he would go to the apartment to make sure she doesn't.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adam sends me a text message saying he went there and she wasn't throwing my stuff out.
      </li>
      <li>
        I call the Portland Police Non-Emergency number explaining that my girlfriend is threatening to throw my stuff out.
      </li>
      <li>
        She sends me two text messages, one asking if she should remove my belongings from the apartment, and the other stating that someone suggested that she do so.
      </li>
      <li>
        An hour and half later, she sends me a text message that reads &ldquo;Hey, your friend came over and I gave em some of your stuff.&rdquo;
      </li>
      <li>
        One minute later, she sends another text message stating that she'd been trying to confirm, but I wouldn't answer my phone, so she guesses that &ldquo;it's all good.&rdquo;
      </li>
      <li>
        She leaves a voicemail where she claims that my friend is there asking for everything. She again admits that she hasn't received any confirmation from me, but she's going to give him my stuff anyway.
      </li>
      <li>
        She sends another text message stating that because she hasn't heard from me, she's not giving anymore of my stuff away. She then says &ldquo;This entire thing seems shady af&rdquo;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> (No shit, shady as fuck.) </p>
    <p> Legally speaking, </p>
      <blockquote>
      In tort law, implied consent is a defense to an intentional tort. The plaintiff's consent is implied when the plaintiff fails to object, or is silent in a situation in which a reasonable person would object to the defendant's action. &ndash; <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/implied_consent" target="_blank">Cornell Law School website,</a>,
      </blockquote>
    <p>
      One could feasibly assert that by not responding, my silence implied consent. However, this is a sham defense by definition, 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      &ldquo;A sham plea is good on its face, but false in fact; it may, to all appearances, constitute a perfect defense, but is a pretense because false and because not pleaded in good faith.&rdquo; &ndash; Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edition, pg. 796 
    </blockquote>
    <p> And it's a sham defense for the following reasons. </p>
    <p> 
      One, <strong>it's false in fact</strong> because I didn't send anyone to the apartment to pick up any of my stuff. I stated this in my Declaration which was made under penalty of perjury and which I will repeat here. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      I did not communicate with anyone via any medium at any time that night or that day or prior to that night or that day for the purpose of sending someone to the apartment to pick up any of my belongings. 
    </blockquote>
    <p> The following evidence corroborates this: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages-log/incident-calls-and-messages.html" target="_blank">Incident Calls and Messages Log</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="docs/declaration-of-matthew-rebello/" target="_blank">Declaration of Matthew Rebello</a> 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Two, <strong>it was not made in good faith</strong> because she expressed her intent to remove my belongings from the apartment hours before she claimed that she gave some of my stuff to a &ldquo;friend.&rdquo; And I told her more than once over the phone not to do it. 
    </p>
    <p> The following evidence corroborates this: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="docs/declaration-of-matthew-rebello/" target="_blank">Declaration of Matthew Rebello</a> 
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="docs/audio/" target="_blank">My conversation with the Non-Emergency dispatcher</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages-log/incident-calls-and-messages.html" target="_blank">text message</a> from our roommate, Adam
      </li>
      <li>
        Her own <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages-log/incident-calls-and-messages.html" target="_blank">text messages</a> she sent me that night
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Furthermore, her own language in her text messages and voicemail on the night of the incident is unequivocal regarding who did what. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        &ldquo;Hey, your friend came over and I gave em some of your stuff.&rdquo; 
      </li>
      <li>
        &ldquo;Am I supposed to give him this stuff&rdquo; 
      </li>
      <li>
        &ldquo;Do I have to give your friend everything?&rdquo; 
      </li>
      <li>
        &ldquo;You're not answering So I'm not giving anymore of your stuff until you do.&rdquo;
      </li>
      <li>
        &ldquo;They say they're picking it up for you, but you're not answering my phone calls. So I'm not giving it to them.&rdquo;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It's clear that she was the actor, and the one responsible for giving my stuff away. At no point did she say &ldquo;Your friend came over and took your stuff,&rdquo; or anything substantially equivalent. Nor did she use any language indicating that they barged in, broke in, climbed in through the window, or otherwise entered forcibly. Even the phrase &ldquo;they're picking it up for you&rdquo; implies a handing over and acceptance, rather than an appropriation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a criminal case, the standard of proof is &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt;&rdquo; whereas in a civil case, which includes small claims, the standard of proof is &ldquo;by the preponderance of evidence.&rdquo; Or, as a lawyer told me, it's more likely than not that the defendant did what the plaintiff alleges.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the preponderance of evidence, I think it's far more likely than not that she gave away my stuff as she claimed she did. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Facts aside, even if I intended on moving out that weekend, and I sent people to the apartment to pick up some of my stuff, I would have let her know. I would have told her who it was, when they were going to be there, and what they were picking up, because that would have been the considerate and reasonable thing to do. </p>
    <p>
      Also, if I were in her position and some complete strangers showed up at the apartment claiming that they were her friends and were there to pick up some of her stuff, I would have contacted her to confirm. If I couldn't get a hold of her, I would have told the people to get her on the phone so that I could confirm with her myself. If they were unwilling or unable to do so, I would have said &ldquo;Nope. Not happening,&rdquo; and shut the door in their faces. I don't care how rocky our relationship was at the time, I wouldn't let complete strangers who show up in the middle of the night claiming to be her friends into the apartment to take her belongings without any confirmation from her.

  <details> 
    <summary class="claim">Claim No. 2: She didn't give some of my stuff away</summary>
    <article>
    <p>
      On the first night of the incident, she said repeatedly and unequivocally that she gave my stuff away, then a week later she said she didn't. 
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday November 9, I came to the apartment to pick up the last of my stuff. While I was in the kitchen packing a box, she came out of the bedroom and we had substantially the following exchange.
    </p>
    <p class="dialog"> &ldquo;Can you do that tomorrow?&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="dialog"> &ldquo;I'm almost done.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="dialog"> &ldquo;So come back tomorrow then.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="dialog"> &ldquo;I'm almost done.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="dialog"> &ldquo;Then come back tomorrow!&rdquo; </p>
    <p>
      Her logic nearly baffled me, but I continued packing while she went to the bathroom. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I finished, I put the box on the porch, and left the front door open so that before I left I could give her a letter that I had written for her earlier that day. When she came out of the bathroom I tried to hand it to her. She refused to take it. I insisted. She still refused. I remember her exclaiming &ldquo;I don't want it!&rdquo; So I set it on the shelf just inside the bedroom door. Not only did she refuse to take it, she refused to even have it in her vicinity. She took the letter and put it in the box that I had just set on the porch. I told her that if she wouldn't accept it, I would just tell her what it said. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't remember all of it because I don't have it anymore, but I remember the first sentence which I recited to her. &ldquo;I was hoping for an amicable break up but your actions precluded it.&rdquo; I then explained that what she did was called conversion which is a tort, and the only legal remedy is the return of the belongings. She had no idea what I was talking about, so I made it more concrete. I told her I wanted my stuff back. She said she didn't know where it was. I said &ldquo;You gave it away. You can get it back.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;No, I didn't!&rdquo; 
    </p>
    <p class="nerd"> Nerd Alert: </p>
    <p>
      There is a fundamental principle of logic called the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/" target="_blank">Law of Non-Contradiction</a> which states that a proposition and its opposite cannot both be true. For example, it cannot both be true that she gave away my stuff and did not give away my stuff. Regardless of whether she did or didn't, one of those statements must be false. Yet, she made both statements&ndash;one repeatedly, the other adamantly&ndash;and she tried to convince me that they were true. In other words, she made a false statement with intent to deceive which means by definition she lied. 
    </p>
    <p> Considering the circumstances which are that </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        On the afternoon of Saturday November 2, I was in possession of all my belongings;
      </li>
      <li>
        On the evening of Saturday November 2, she said she gave away some of my stuff; and
      </li>
      <li>
        On Monday November 4, some of my stuff was missing;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It seems far more reasonable to conclude that she was telling the truth when she said she gave away my stuff, and was lying when she later said she didn't. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, if she didn't give away my belongings, then I would still be in my possession of them, and I would have had no reason to sue her, nor feel compelled to write this long-winded counterspeech diatribe.

      <summary class="claim"> Claim No. 3: I ripped her off and I'm on meth </summary>
      <article>
        <p>
          On Tuesday December 17 2024, after I had moved out, I went to the bar by our former apartment hoping to engage in some humorous and off-color banter with one of my favorite bartenders, a woman who I will refer to as A. She befriended G while we were together, but I had known her for several years prior. I asked A if she knew that I moved out. A said that G told her that I ripped her off, that I was on meth, and that I came to the apartment one night to steal more of her stuff but she was home so I left. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the first I had heard of her slander. I'd say shock and disbelief would accurately describe my reaction. The only thing that sounded even remotely similar to this is when I came to the apartment to drop off the key after I moved out. Unless my memory was so altered because of a methamphetamine-induced psychosis, this is what actually happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several times in November after I moved out, I found some of her belongings mixed in with mine: several shirts, a dress, a CD, a poster, a beer koozie, and a copy of The Man in the High Castle. (The last is rather apropos considering that it's an alternative history, like the one she's attempting with her slander.) I considered just throwing it all out, but I didn't want to give her an excuse to accuse me of stealing her stuff, so I made several trips to return it. Ironically, she still accused me of stealing her stuff despite this. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On November 15, I made the first trip to return her belongings. I dropped off her dress and some other things on the porch of the apartment. Afterwards, she texted me and we had the following exchange.
        </p>
        <p class="dialog">
          &ldquo;Hey. Um.. that dress isn't mine, might want to give that back to your friend. I asked for my pants but if that's not possible, then fine. If you want em, have em.&rdquo; 
        </p>
        <p class="dialog">
          &ldquo;I want my guitars and my comic books back.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p class="dialog">
          &ldquo;Ask your friends. And when you do, tell em I want my shit back, too.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          (If I had actually sent some friends to the apartment to pick up some of my stuff, it would have been for the purpose of them bringing it to me; in which case, I would still be in possession of my belongings and I would have had no reason to tell her that I wanted it back nor sue her in small claims court. Silly goose.)
        </p>
        <p>
          On Sunday December 1, I came to the apartment to drop off the key, return her Dot's Cafe shirt, and make a final attempt to look for my bag of kitchen utensils that had been on the kitchen counter since I moved into the apartment in September 2021. I couldn't find them but while looking I found a mass of black clothes on the bottom shelf of a kitchen cabinet all the way in the back. When I pulled it out, I saw that it was two of my favorite band shirts: Aura Noir and Unleashed. I had a WTF moment but resignedly just put them in my backpack. I then put the apartment key on my roommate's dresser in his bedroom, and texted him afterwards that I did so. Before I left, she came out of the bedroom. I presented her Dot's Cafe shirt to her, set it on a chair, and then left. When I got home, I dumped out my backpack and discovered that in addition to my shirts were a pair of her pants. 
        </p>
        <p>
          (The same pair of pants she wanted back? Who knows?)
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday December 6, I left her pants in a bag on the porch of the apartment along with the last of her things, and then sent her a text that said 
        </p>
        <p class="dialog">
          &ldquo;I found your pants. They were in the kitchen next to my shirts. You had them the whole time.&rdquo; 
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back to the bar on December 17.
        </p>
        <p>
          After A informed me of G's slanderous remarks, I went to the bathroom. When I came back to resume my barstool, G's coke dealer was sitting a few stools down. We said hello. He's an amiable fellow. G appeared next to him shortly after. They were about six feet away from me when A, in her capacity as a mediator, said to G &ldquo;Why don't you two go on the patio and work it out?&rdquo; G responded &ldquo;I don't want to talk to that psycho!&rdquo; I just laughed, and left shortly thereafter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her antics can be sheerly mind-boggling sometimes. I mean, who does that? She packs my clothes. She hides two of my shirts in a kitchen cabinet along with a pair of her own pants that she later claims she wants back. I return all of her belongings despite the fact that she gave away a bunch of mine. Then she turns around and tells somebody I know that I ripped her off and I'm on meth, and then shows up at the bar with her coke dealer. 
        </p>
        <p> And she calls me a psycho! </p>

        Claim No. 4: She didn't pack my clothes
      </summary>
      <article>
      <p>
        On Saturday November 2, my clothes were where they normally were: hanging in the closet, or folded on a shelf. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On Sunday November 3, I came to the apartment to pick up some necessities to get through my upcoming work week so that I could move out the following weekend. I didn't look in the closet, but it did not appear that my clothes had been moved.  While I was there she showed up. She told me to leave and come back tomorrow while she was at work, and tried to prevent me from getting what I needed. I got fed up with her attitude and asked her twice if I could trust her to leave my things undisturbed until the next day when I could move out. She agreed the second time. Later that night she called and threatened to put my stuff on the porch. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday November 4, I came back to the apartment to move out, and my clothes were in two hampers in the living room and a duffel bag on the porch. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On December 27, she called me under false pretenses to check on my well-being. At one point during the call, I reminded her that I found my shirts in a kitchen cabinet next to her pants. She feigned ignorance. We then had the following exchange shortly before I hung up on her.
      </p>
      <p class="dialog">
        &ldquo;You packed my clothes.&rdquo; 
      </p>
      <p class="dialog">
        &ldquo;No, I didn't.&rdquo; 
      </p>
      <p class="dialog">
        &ldquo;Then who did?&rdquo; 
      </p>
      <p class="dialog">
        &ldquo;I don't know!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        How could she not know? She threatened to put my stuff on the porch on Nov 3, and the next day a duffel bag full of my clothes was on the porch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously my clothes didn't pack themselves, and I highly doubt our roommate Adam would have done it even if she'd asked him to. The only explanations that make any sense are listed below in order, starting with the most reasonable and devolving into pure lunacy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          She did it herself, but for reasons known only to her she chose to deny it.
        </li>
        <li>
          She had someone do it for her and is lying about not knowing who did it.
        </li>
        <li>
          She invited a complete stranger to the apartment or had someone send a complete stranger to the apartment whom she directed to pack my clothes, thereby giving her plausible deniability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone broke into the apartment, didn't steal or break anything, but decided to take all my clothes&ndash; and my clothes alone &ndash;put them in two hampers and a duffel bag; then as an afterthought, arbitrarily picked out two shirts and a pair of pants, hid them in a kitchen cabinet, then left the duffel bag on the porch after locking the door behind them.

          A roaming poltergeist, powerful yet surprisingly organized and selective, blew through the neighborhood looking to cause mayhem; descended upon the apartment; teleported my clothes from off the hangers and off the shelf into two hampers and a duffel bag; and, in a final act of mischief, apported through solid matter two of my favorite shirts, a pair of her pants, and the duffel bag of clothes before returning to the Alibi to repose and snicker.

  <!-- Her Manipulation -->

  <h2> Her Manipulation </h2>
  <p>
    First, having related all that unflattering information about her (sadly, there's more to come), to balance the scales, I should add in all fairness that I AM NOT PERFECT. I experience sub-optimum mental phenomena on a regular basis with its attendant physiological manifestations. In other words, I've developed a tick. Some of my co-workers who've inadvertently witnessed it probably think I have mental problems. But who doesn't? I'm organized and conscientious, so fuck &lsquo;em. Also, I have a temper, bad breath, and I fart a lot. Kudos to her for putting up with me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, I will add that the first eight months G and I were together were amazing. We were madly in love. We spent every day together with few exceptions. She was my best friend. We had a lot of good times and a lot of laughs&ndash;even up to the end. I miss that woman. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Then she got fired from the Alibi for drinking on the job. She criticized me for weeks and months because I didn't quit in protest despite the fact that she had been there for about nine months and I had been there for five and a half years. That was the first red flag. If we hadn't been living together, I probably would have broken up with her then. But if I had, I wouldn't know what I know now. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on what I learned about her since the incident, the woman that gave my stuff away is not the same woman that I fell in love with. If you currently associate with her, you should be aware of some of her manipulative behavior.

      No. 1: The Poopyhead Maneuver
    </summary>
    <article>
    <p>
      I was the recipient of this so often that I gave it a name. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When any criticism or accusation comes her way, whether express or implied, she immediately redirects it back to the person making it&ndash;in this case, me. I call it &ldquo;The Poopyhead Maneuver&rdquo; because it reminds me of two elementary school kids on the playground. One says to the other &ldquo;You're a poopyhead,&rdquo; and the other says &ldquo;No, YOU'RE a poopyhead!&rdquo; And sadly that's about the level of intelligence required to execute the maneuver.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a brilliant form of manipulation because most normal people when accused or criticized will consider it and address it accordingly. I think she knows this on some level, and that's why she does it. For one, it puts the other person on the defensive. And two, it allows her to avoid confronting or addressing the accusation or criticism all together. In fact, by doing so she doesn't even have to acknowledge it. She just immediately and automatically redirects it as if by reflex.
    </p>
    <p>
      (I'm not a clinical psychologist, but if I were to make an educated guess, I'd say it's a defensive mechanism learned long ago. She told me some things about her childhood which sounded rough, so I sympathize with her.)
    </p>
    <p> 
      Here are two examples of the Poopyhead Maneuver in action. 
    </p>

    <!-- Example 1 -->

    <details>
      <summary class="claim">
        Example 1: <em>No, YOU'RE being unreasonable!</em>
      </summary>
      <article>
      <p>
        She called me near midnight on Sunday November 3 2024 saying that she was going to put my stuff on the porch and that I should come and get it. This was after she agreed earlier that day to leave my stuff undisturbed until the next day when I could move out. I told her not to do it; she persisted. I told her she was being completely unreasonable. She responded &ldquo;No, YOU'RE being unreasonable!&rdquo; 
      </p>
      <p>
        Later I thought, what exactly would have been her idea of me being reasonable in that situation? For me to come over and help her put my stuff on the porch? For me to give her encouragement and affirmations while she threw my stuff over the second floor railing onto the parking lot? In the middle of the night? After I paid her rent for two months?       
      </p>
      <p>
        Seems reasonable.

    <details>
      <summary class="claim">
        Example 2: <em>I filed a police report, too!</em>
      </summary>
      <article>
    <p>
      She called me at 10:09 PM on Friday December 27 2024. She said someone told her I wasn't well and she should check on me. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I had an immediate physiological response. My brows furrowed, my eyes squinted, the edges of my mouth pulled back toward my ears, my chin moved toward my neck, and my head shook involuntarily. In other words, I experienced incredulity and suspicion simultaneously. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I pondered for a moment how to respond, then said &ldquo;What the fuck are you talking about?&rdquo; She repeated her statement. I pondered momentarily how to respond and said &ldquo;I just want my stuff back.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; I reminded her that she already admitted giving my stuff away. She again denied doing so. I told her that her text messages are part of a police report. She said &ldquo;I filed a police report, too!&rdquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      (I have a document from the Portland Police Bureau that clearly shows that there's no record of her filing a police report between November 2 2024, the date of the incident, and March 12 2025, the date the document was printed. Another claim refuted.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I eventually ended the call by saying &ldquo;You're a liar. Don't talk to me anymore.&rdquo; She called me back immediately, of course. Twice. I didn't answer. She then sent me several text messages. The first one reiterated and qualified her reason for calling. 
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">
      &ldquo;The only reason I called you was because someone said that you weren't well and asked me to check in on you&rdquo; 
    </p>
    <p class="dialog">
      &ldquo;Also, I guess I can tell you that your police report is considered fraud because my job was able to prove that I was at work when you called&rdquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      (Called her when? If you look at Incident Calls and Messages Log, you'll see that I didn't call her that night. Not once. Whereas, she called me many times. Also, the issue is that she said she gave away some of my stuff and two days later my stuff was missing. Where she was when I allegedly called her is irrelevant.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked what the case number of her police report is. She responded &ldquo;69420. Go fuck yourself&rdquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      (Why would she call me to check on my well-being, then afterwards tell me to go fuck myself? Rude.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In her last text messages, she said that I was on speaker phone with her &ldquo;lawyer/paralegal&rdquo; and that I should expect a letter in the mail. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This begs the question: if the only reason she called me was to check on my well-being, then why was I on speaker phone with her &ldquo;lawyer/paralegal?&rdquo; And which was it, a lawyer or a paralegal? Was she on speaker phone with both her lawyer and her paralegal? Was it a lawyer who used to be a paralegal but has to remind everyone of their rise to greatness from their humble beginnings as a lowly paralegal? Or was it some guy she met at a bar who happens to be a paralegal but aspires to be both her lawyer and her lover? Her paralover perhaps? In any case, who talks to their lawyer at 10:09 PM on a Friday? Also, it's been nearly eight months as of the time of this writing and I still have not received a letter from a lawyer, a paralegal, nor any law firm or paralegal service.

      No. 2: She misrepresents her past to portray herself as a victim
    </summary>
    <article>
      <p>
        In February 2023, she got hired at the Alibi where I was working. We both had an affinity for dark humor and each other's appearance. We hit it off right away. We exchanged numbers around February 25. Our first date was March 5. During this time, she told me and others at the Alibi that she fled Utah to escape an abusive boyfriend. We all sympathized with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        On March 7, one of the bartenders from the Alibi sent a group text message to the rest of the employees announcing that G's ex-boyfriend (hereinafter, &ldquo;E&rdquo;) came into the bar looking for her. On or about that day, I told G that she could stay at my apartment because I only lived four blocks away, and she would be safe there. Later that night, she asked me via text message if she could add my address to a restraining order that she was filing against him online. I agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, she began staying at the apartment on a regular basis. By April, she had essentially moved in. In late April, one of E's family members informed her that he had taken his own life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to the present.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the incident and her subsequent slander, it occurred to me that if she did that to me, she may have done something similar to E and fled Utah to escape accountability. To satisfy my morbid curiosity, I contacted one of his family members. (I know that makes me look bad, but it turned out to be a fruitful endeavor.) This person didn't know G but he forwarded my email to his cousin who did. I ended up having a lengthy, informative, and emotional email exchange with a woman who I will refer to as M. 
      </p>
      <p>
        M told me a vastly different story than the one that G related to me regarding their relationship and her departure from Utah. It's a story in itself, and I think it's worth retelling. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To establish a baseline for comparison, here's my recollection of G's version.
      </p>

      <!-- The Origin Story of a Not-So-Super Villain -->

      <p class="claim"> The Origin Story of a Not-So-Super Villain </p>

      <p>
        G met E at the Slabtown New Seasons as co-workers. She was sleeping on the couch at some old creepy guy's apartment. She ended up moving in with E. They became romantically involved. After some time, they decided to move to Utah where he was from. He moved there first to get settled and line up a job for both of them. She followed several months later. They worked at a brewery near Zion National Park. She enjoyed working there. He drank a lot, got fired, and she had to support both of them. His drinking continued. He became abusive. He threw a burrito at her while she was lying in bed. One night, he left the house with a friend to go out drinking, and she used that opportunity to quickly pack up and leave. She took the car and headed back to Portland. She ran out of gas along the way, and had to ask someone to send her money. When she got to Portland, she stayed on a female friend's couch somewhere on Interstate Ave. She got hired at the Alibi soon after. E tracked her down from Utah and confronted her on the patio of the Alibi. She told her Alibi co-workers that her abusive ex-boyfriend was stalking her and she had a restraining order against him in Utah. She told me afterwards that he must have put a tracking app on her phone while they were still in Utah.
      </p>
      <p>
        An unfortunate story, and one that would make anyone sympathize with her.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the majority of the story isn't true. The verifiables are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They worked together at New Seasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          They lived together in Portland. 
        </li>
        <li>
          They lived together in Utah.
        </li>
        <li>
          She got hired at the Alibi. 
        </li>
        <li>
          He came to the Alibi looking for her, and confronted her on the patio. 
        </li>
        <li>
          He took his own life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If what M says is true, everything else is pure fabrication. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example. I have a letter from the Multnomah County Circuit Court Records Clerk stating that there's no record of a protective order being filed with either of their names between 1988 and 2025. I also have an email from a Judicial Assistant at the Fifth District Court, Washington County, Utah which has jurisdiction in the town of Springdale where they were living, stating that there's no record of a protective order under her name.
      </p>
      <p>
        M did not give me permission to publish our email exchange, so here is a summary of her version of events.
      </p>

      <!-- The Tragic End to a Troubled Man  -->

      <p class="claim"> The Tragic End to a Troubled Man </p>
      <p>
        G met E at New Seasons as co-workers. He had just gotten out of rehab a month prior. She complained about her bad roommate situation. He offered her a safe place to crash. She never moved out. They became romantically involved. Her presence caused tension with his roommate. 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;Pretty soon, E---- learned that Gyps' love is the choking kind. He felt suffocated because they worked and lived together. He tried changing shifts and changing jobs but she followed him every time. They fought about it, and he began drinking again.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        E asked M to take him to rehab while G was at work. E knew G would shame him out of getting help, and hoped she would be gone when he got out. She was still living there when he did. They reconciled but it didn't last. She convinced him that rehab had been a mistake. Six months later, his sister flew to Portland to take him to medical detox. They cancelled his phone plan, got a new number that G wouldn't have, and left for Utah.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Springdale he began &ldquo;sorting out the mindfuck that Gyps had been.&rdquo; Six months later G showed up. She ingratiated her way back into his life. E helped her get a job, but she got fired from three places.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;She blamed him &amp; punished him because things weren't going well for her.&rdquo;
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        She barricaded herself in the bedroom, and made him sleep on the couch. Their roommates broke up with her on his behalf, and told her she had to move out because &ldquo;she was making everyone miserable &amp; wasn't contributing rent.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He drove her to the Las Vegas airport so she could go to Colorado for a job she had lined up. She came back less than 48 hours later. They tried to stay at one of his aunts in Vegas, but she was recovering from a stroke. They sold his phone for gas money and drove to Portland. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This was February 2023, around the time she got hired at the Alibi. They were living in his car and trying to figure out their next step. 
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        &ldquo;He told me that they were both wasted, she was screaming at him and hit him. He snapped and hit her back. She left. At that point, she had drained him of everything &ndash; money, relationships, living situations &ndash; and she was brutal in the way she dismissed him.&rdquo; 
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        On April 23 2023, he took his own life.
      </p>
      <h3 class="rip"> R.I.P., E.R.L. </h3>
      <p>
        Obviously, the two versions are vastly different. G's version is nearly a complete inversion of reality. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To quote M again, &ldquo;I'm writing all this in hopes that she won't ever do this kind of damage to anyone else.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As am I.

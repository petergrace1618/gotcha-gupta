If I couldn&rsquo;t get a hold of her, I would have told the people to get her on the phone so that I could confirm with her myself. If they were unwilling or unable to do so, I would have said &ldquo;Nope. Not happening,&rdquo; and shut the door in their faces. I don&rsquo;t care how rocky our relationship was at the time, I wouldn&rsquo;t let complete strangers who show up in the middle of the night claiming to be her friends into the apartment to take her belongings without any confirmation from her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10 c11">Claim No. 2: She </span><span class="c3 c11">didn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c11 c10 c21">&nbsp;give some of my stuff away</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the first night of the incident, she said repeatedly and unequivocally that she gave my stuff away, then a week later she said she didn&#39;t. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Saturday November 9, I came to the apartment to pick up the last of my stuff. While I was in the kitchen packing a box, she came out of the bedroom and we had substantially the following exchange.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you do that tomorrow?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So come back tomorrow then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then come back tomorrow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her logic nearly baffled me, but I continued packing while she went to the bathroom. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I finished, I put the box on the porch, and left the front door open so that before I left I could give her a letter that I had written for her earlier that day. When she came out of the bathroom I tried to hand it to her. She refused to take it. I insisted. She still refused. I remember her exclaiming &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it!&rdquo; So I set it on the shelf just inside the bedroom door. Not only did she refuse to take it, she refused to even have it in her vicinity. She took the letter and put it in the box that I had just set on the porch. I told her that if she wouldn&rsquo;t accept it, I would just tell her what it said. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t remember all of it because I don&rsquo;t have it anymore, but I remember the first sentence which I recited to her. &ldquo;I was hoping for an amicable break up but your actions precluded it.&rdquo; I then explained that what she did was called conversion which is a tort, and the only legal remedy is the return of the belongings. She had no idea what I was talking about, so I made it more concrete. I told her I wanted my stuff back. She said she didn&rsquo;t know where it was. I said &ldquo;You gave it away. You can get it back.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c18 c22">Nerd Alert:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">There is a fundamental principle of logic called the </span><span class="c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750265994504927&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hFiMKe1hUXvzYYsX5iVM1">Law of Non-Contradiction</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which states that a proposition and its opposite cannot both be true.

Yet, she made both statements&ndash;one repeatedly, the other adamantly&ndash;and she tried to convince me that they were true.

She befriended G while we were together, but I had known her for several years prior. I asked A if she knew that I moved out. A said that G told her that I ripped her off, that I was on meth, and that I came to the apartment one night to steal more of her stuff but she was home so I left. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was the first I had heard of her slander. I&rsquo;d say shock and disbelief would accurately describe my reaction. The only thing that sounded even remotely similar to this is when I came to the apartment to drop off the key after I moved out. Unless my memory was so altered because of a methamphetamine-induced psychosis, this is what actually happened.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Several times in November after I moved out, I found some of her belongings mixed in with mine: several shirts, a dress, a CD, a poster, a beer koozie, and a copy of The Man in the High Castle. (The last is rather apropos considering that it&rsquo;s an alternative history, like the one she&rsquo;s attempting with her slander.) I considered just throwing it all out, but I didn&rsquo;t want to give her an excuse to accuse me of stealing her stuff, so I made several trips to return it. Ironically, she still accused me of stealing her stuff despite this. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On November 15, I made the first trip to return her belongings. I dropped off her dress and some other things on the porch of the apartment. Afterwards, she texted me and we had the following exchange.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey. Um.. that dress isn&#39;t mine, might want to give that back to your friend. I asked for my pants but if that&#39;s not possible, then fine. If you want em, have em.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want my guitars and my comic books back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ask your friends. And when you do, tell em I want my shit back, too.&rdquo; [_]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(If I had actually sent some friends to the apartment to pick up some of my stuff, it would have been for the purpose of them bringing it to me; in which case, I would still be in possession of my belongings and I would have had no reason to tell her that I wanted it back nor sue her in small claims court. Silly goose.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">O</span><span class="c0">n Sunday December 1, I came to the apartment to drop off the key, to return her Dot&rsquo;s Cafe shirt, and to make a final attempt to look for my bag of kitchen utensils that had been on the kitchen counter since I moved into the apartment in September 2021. I couldn&#39;t find them but while looking I found a mass of black clothes on the bottom shelf of a kitchen cabinet all the way in the back. When I pulled it out, I saw that it was two of my favorite band shirts: Aura Noir and Unleashed. I had a WTF moment but resignedly just put them in my backpack. I then put the apartment key on my roommate&rsquo;s dresser in his bedroom, and texted him afterwards that I did so. [_] Before I left, she came out of the bedroom. I presented her Dot&rsquo;s Cafe shirt to her, set it on a chair, and then left. When I got home, I dumped out my backpack and discovered that in addition to my shirts were a pair of her pants. (The same pair of pants she wanted back? Who knows?)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Friday December 6, I left her pants in a bag on the porch of the apartment along with the last of her things, and then sent her a text that said </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I found your pants. They were in the kitchen next to my shirts. You had them the whole time.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She didn&rsquo;t respond. [_]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Back to the bar on December 17.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After A informed me of G&rsquo;s slanderous remarks, I went to the bathroom. When I came back to resume my barstool, G&rsquo;s coke dealer was sitting a few stools down. We said hello. He&rsquo;s an amiable fellow. G appeared next to him shortly after. They were about six feet away from me when A, in her capacity as a mediator, said to G &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you two go on the patio and work it out?&rdquo; G responded &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to that psycho!&rdquo; I just laughed, and left shortly thereafter.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Her antics can be sheerly mind-boggling sometimes. I mean, who does that? She packs my clothes. She hides two of my shirts in a kitchen cabinet along with a pair of her own pants that she later claims she wants back. I </span><span class="c10">return</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;all of her belongings despite the fact that she gave away a bunch of mine. Then she turns around and tells somebody I know that I ripped her off and I&rsquo;m on meth, and then shows up at the bar with her coke dealer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">And she calls </span><span class="c3">me</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;a psycho! </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c11 c10">Claim No. 4: She didn&rsquo;t pack my clothes</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Saturday November 2, my clothes were where they normally were: hanging in the closet, or folded on a shelf. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Sunday November 3, I came to the apartment to pick up some necessities to get through my upcoming work week so that I could move out the following weekend. I didn&#39;t look in the closet, but it did not appear that my clothes had been moved. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While I was there she showed up. She told me to leave and come back tomorrow while she was at work, and tried to prevent me from getting what I needed. I got fed up with her attitude and asked her twice if I could trust her to leave my things undisturbed until the next day when I could move out. She agreed the second time. Later that night she called and threatened to put my stuff on the porch. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On Monday November 4, I came back to the apartment to move out, and my clothes were in two hampers in the living room and a duffel bag on the porch. [_]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On December 27, she called me under false pretenses to check on my well-being. [_] At one point during the call, I reminded her that I found my shirts in a kitchen cabinet next to her pants. She feigned ignorance. [_] We then had the following exchange shortly before I hung up on her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You packed my clothes.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then who did?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How could she not know? She threatened to put my stuff on the porch on Nov 3, and the next day a duffel bag full of my clothes was on the porch.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obviously my clothes didn&rsquo;t pack themselves, and I highly doubt our roommate Adam would have done it even if she&rsquo;d asked him to. The only explanations that make any sense are listed below in order, starting with the most reasonable and devolving into pure lunacy.</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_m052mn8bbp4d-0 start"><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She did it herself, but for reasons known only to her she chose to deny it.</span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She had someone do it for her and is lying about not knowing who did it.</span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She invited a complete stranger to the apartment or had someone send a complete stranger to the apartment whom she directed to pack my clothes, thereby giving her plausible deniability.</span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Someone broke into the apartment, didn&rsquo;t steal or break anything, but decided to take all my clothes&ndash;</span><span class="c3">and my clothes alone</span><span class="c0">&ndash;put them in two hampers and a duffel bag; then as an afterthought, arbitrarily picked out two shirts and a pair of pants, hid them in a kitchen cabinet, then left the duffel bag on the porch after locking the door behind them. </span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A roaming poltergeist, powerful yet surprisingly organized and selective, blew through the neighborhood looking to cause mayhem; descended upon the apartment; teleported my clothes from off the hangers and off the shelf into two hampers and a duffel bag; and, in a final act of mischief, apported through solid matter two of my favorite shirts, a pair of her pants, and the duffel bag of clothes before returning to the Alibi to repose and snicker.</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reductio%2520ad%2520absurdum&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750265994520080&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OpQkFlBRghMEPZlfDYKpc">Reductio Ad Absurdum?</a></span></p><p class="c2 c14"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c19">Her Manipulation</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">First, having related all that unflattering information about her (sadly, there&#39;s more to come), to balance the scales, I should add in all fairness that I AM NOT PERFECT. I experience sub-optimum mental phenomena on a regular basis with its attendant physiological manifestations. In other words, I&rsquo;ve developed a tick. Some of my co-workers who&rsquo;ve inadvertently witnessed it probably think I have mental problems. But who doesn&rsquo;t? I&rsquo;m organized and conscientious, so fuck &lsquo;em. Also, I have a temper, bad breath, and I fart a lot. Kudos to her for putting up with me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Second, I will add that the first eight months G and I were together were amazing. We were madly in love. We spent </span><span class="c10">every day</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;together with few exceptions. She was my best friend. We had a lot of good times and a lot of laughs&ndash;even up to the end. I miss that woman. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then she got fired from the Alibi for drinking on the job. She criticized me for weeks and months because I didn&rsquo;t quit in protest despite the fact that she had been there for about nine months and I had been there for five and a half years. That was the first red flag. If we hadn&rsquo;t been living together, I probably would have broken up with her then. But if I had, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what I know now. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Based on what I learned about her since the incident, the woman that gave my stuff away is not the same woman that I fell in love with. If you currently associate with her, you should be aware of some of her manipulative behavior. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c18 c22">No. 1: The Poopyhead Maneuver</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">I was the recipient of this </span><span class="c0">so often that I gave it a name. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When any criticism or accusation comes her way, whether express or implied, she immediately redirects it back to the person making it&ndash;in this case, me. I call it &ldquo;The Poopyhead Maneuver&rdquo; because it reminds me of two elementary school kids on the playground. One says to the other &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a poopyhead,&rdquo; and the other says &ldquo;No, YOU&rsquo;RE a poopyhead!&rdquo; And sadly that&rsquo;s about the level of intelligence required to execute the maneuver.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a brilliant form of manipulation because most normal people when accused or criticized will consider it and address it accordingly. I think she knows this on some level, and that&rsquo;s why she does it. For one, it puts the other person on the defensive. And two, it allows her to avoid confronting or addressing the accusation or criticism all together. In fact, by doing so she doesn&rsquo;t even have to acknowledge it. She just immediately and automatically redirects it as if by reflex.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(I&rsquo;m not a clinical psychologist, but if I were to make an educated guess, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a defensive mechanism learned long ago. She told me some things about her childhood which sounded rough, so I sympathize with her.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Here are two examples of the </span><span class="c10">Poopyhead</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Maneuver in action. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c11 c10">Example 1: No, YOU&rsquo;RE being unreasonable!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She called me near midnight on Sunday November 3 2024 saying that she was going to put my stuff on the porch and that I should come and get it. This was after she agreed earlier that day to leave my stuff undisturbed until the next day when I could move out. [_] I told her not to do it; she persisted. I told her she was being completely unreasonable. She responded &ldquo;No, YOU&rsquo;RE being unreasonable!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">L</span><span class="c10">ater I thought, what exactly would have been her idea of me being reasonable in that situation? For me</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to come over and help her put my stuff on the porch? For me to give her encouragement and affirmations while she threw my stuff over the second floor railing onto the parking lot? In the middle of the night? After I paid her rent for two months? Seems reasonable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c11 c10">Example 2: I filed a police report, too!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She called me at 10:09 PM on Friday December 27 2024. [_] She said someone told her I wasn&rsquo;t well and she should check on me. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I had an immediate physiological response. My brows furrowed, my eyes squinted, the edges of my mouth pulled back toward my ears, my chin moved toward my neck, and my head shook involuntarily. In other words, I experienced incredulity and suspicion simultaneously. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I pondered for a moment how to respond, then said &ldquo;What the fuck are you talking about?&rdquo; She repeated her statement. I pondered momentarily how to respond and said &ldquo;I just want my stuff back.&rdquo; She said &ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; I reminded her that she already admitted giving my stuff away. [_] She again denied doing so. I told her that her text messages are part of a police report. She said &ldquo;I filed a police report, too!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(I have a document from the Portland Police Bureau that clearly shows that there&#39;s no record of her filing a police report between November 2 2024, the date of the incident, and March 12 2025, the date the document was printed. Another claim refuted.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I eventually ended the call by saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar. Don&rsquo;t talk to me anymore.&rdquo; She called me back immediately, of course. Twice. I didn&rsquo;t answer. She then sent me several text messages. The first one reiterated and qualified her reason for calling. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The only reason I called you was because someone said that you weren&#39;t well and asked me to check in on you&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Also, I guess I can tell you that your police report is considered fraud because my job was able to prove that I was at work when you called&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(Called her when? If you look at Incident Calls and Messages Log, you&rsquo;ll see that I didn&rsquo;t call her that night. Not once. Whereas, she called me many times. Also, the issue is that she said she gave away some of my stuff and two days later my stuff was missing. Where she was when I allegedly called her is irrelevant.) </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I asked what the case number of her police report is. She responded &ldquo;69420. Go fuck yourself&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(Why would she call me to check on my well-being, then afterwards tell me to go fuck myself? Rude.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In her last text messages, she said that I was on speaker phone with her &ldquo;lawyer/paralegal&rdquo; and that I should expect a letter in the mail. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">This begs the question: if the only reason she called me was to check on my well-being, then why was I on speaker phone with her &ldquo;lawyer/paralegal?&rdquo; And which was it, a lawyer or a paralegal? Was she on speaker phone with </span><span class="c3">both </span><span class="c10">her lawyer </span><span class="c3">and </span><span class="c0">her paralegal? Was it a lawyer who used to be a paralegal but has to remind everyone of their rise to greatness from their humble beginnings as a lowly paralegal? Or was it some guy she met at a bar who happens to be a paralegal but aspires to be both her lawyer and her lover? Her paralover perhaps? In any case, who talks to their lawyer at 10:09 PM on a Friday? Also, it&rsquo;s been nearly eight months as of the time of this writing and I still have not received a letter from a lawyer, a paralegal, nor any law firm or paralegal service. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Silly goose.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c18 c22">No. 2: She misrepresents her past to portray herself as a victim</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In February 2023, she got hired at the Alibi where I was working. We both had an affinity for dark humor and each other&rsquo;s appearance. We hit it off right away. We exchanged numbers around February 25. Our first date was March 5. During this time, she told me and others at the Alibi that she fled Utah to escape an abusive boyfriend. We all sympathized with her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On March 7, one of the bartenders from the Alibi sent a group text message to the rest of the employees announcing that G&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend (hereinafter, &ldquo;E&rdquo;) came into the bar looking for her. On or about that day, I told G that she could stay at my apartment because I only lived four blocks away, and she would be safe there. Later that night, she asked me via text message if she could add my address to a restraining order that she was filing against him online. I agreed. [_] </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After that, she began staying at the apartment on a regular basis. By April, she had essentially moved in. In late April, one of E&#39;s family members informed her that he had taken his own life. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Back to the present.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After the incident and her subsequent slander, it occurred to me that if she did that to me, she may have done something similar to E and fled Utah to escape accountability. To satisfy my morbid curiosity, I contacted one of his family members. (I know that makes me look bad, but it turned out to be a fruitful endeavor.) This person didn&rsquo;t know G but he forwarded my email to his cousin who did. I ended up having a lengthy, informative, and emotional email exchange with a woman who I will refer to as M. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">M told me a vastly different story than the one that G related to me regarding their relationship and her departure from Utah. It&rsquo;s a story in itself, and I think it&#39;s worth retelling. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">To establish a baseline for comparison, here&rsquo;s m</span><span class="c0">y recollection of G&rsquo;s version.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c11 c10">The Origin Story of a Not-So-Super Villain</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">G </span><span class="c0">met E at the Slabtown New Seasons as co-workers. She was sleeping on the couch at some old creepy guy&rsquo;s apartment. She ended up moving in with E. They became romantically involved. After some time, they decided to move to Utah where he was from. He moved there first to get settled and line up a job for both of them. She followed several months later. They worked at a brewery near Zion National Park. She enjoyed working there. He drank a lot, got fired, and she had to support both of them. His drinking continued. He became abusive. He threw a burrito at her while she was lying in bed. One night, he left the house with a friend to go out drinking, and she used that opportunity to quickly pack up and leave. She took the car and headed back to Portland. She ran out of gas along the way, and had to ask someone to send her money. When she got to Portland, she stayed on a female friend&#39;s couch somewhere on Interstate Ave. She got hired at the Alibi soon after. E tracked her down from Utah and confronted her on the patio of the Alibi. She told her Alibi co-workers that her abusive ex-boyfriend was stalking her and she had a restraining order against him in Utah. She told me afterwards that he must have put a tracking app on her phone while they were still in Utah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An unfortunate story, and one that would make anyone sympathize with her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, the majority of the story isn&#39;t true. The verifiables are:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_xju4acugwkw-0 start"><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">They worked together at New Seasons.</span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">They lived together in Portland. </span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">They lived together in Utah.</span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">She got hired at the Alibi. </span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">He came to the Alibi looking for her, and confronted her on the patio. </span></li><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">He took his own life.</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If what M says is true, everything else is pure fabrication. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s an example. I have a letter from the Multnomah County Circuit Court Records Clerk stating that there&rsquo;s no record of a protective order being filed with either of their names between 1988 and 2025. [_] I also have an email from a Judicial Assistant at the Fifth District Court, Washington County, Utah which has jurisdiction in the town of Springdale where they were living, stating that there&rsquo;s no record of a protective order under her name. [_] </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">M did not give me permission to publish our email exchange, so here is a </span><span class="c0">summary of her version of events.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c21 c11 c10">The Tragic End to a Troubled Man</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">G met E at New Seasons as co-workers. He had just gotten out of rehab a month prior. She complained about her bad roommate situation. He offered her a safe place to crash. She never moved out. They became romantically involved. Her presence caused tension with his roommate. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Pretty soon, E---- learned that Gyps&#39; love is the choking kind. He felt suffocated because they worked and lived together. He tried changing shifts and changing jobs but she followed him every time. They fought about it, and he began drinking again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">E asked M to take him to rehab while G was at work. E knew G would shame him out of getting help, and hoped she would be gone when he got out. She was still living there when he did. They reconciled but it didn&rsquo;t last. She convinced him that rehab had been a mistake. Six months later, his sister flew to Portland to take him to medical detox. They cancelled his phone plan, got a new number that G wouldn&rsquo;t have, and left for Utah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In Springdale he began &quot;sorting out the mindfuck that Gyps had been.&quot; Six months later G showed up. She ingratiated her way back into his life. Ethan helped her get a job, but she got fired from three places.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She blamed him &amp; punished him because things weren&#39;t going well for her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She barricaded herself in the bedroom, and made him sleep on the couch. Their roommates broke up with her on his behalf, and told her she had to move out because &ldquo;she was making everyone miserable &amp; wasn&rsquo;t contributing rent.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He drove her to the Las Vegas airport so she could go to Colorado for a job she had lined up. She came back less than 48 hours later. They tried to stay at one of his aunts in Vegas, but she was recovering from a stroke. They sold his phone for gas money and drove to Portland. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was February 2023, around the time she got hired at the Alibi. They were living in his car and trying to figure out their next step. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He told me that they were both wasted, she was screaming at him and hit him. He snapped and hit her back. She left. At that point, she had drained him of everything &ndash; money, relationships, living situations &ndash; and she was brutal in the way she dismissed him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On April 23 2023, he took his own life.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18">R.I.P., E.R.L.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Obviously, the two versions are vastly different. G&rsquo;s version is nearly a complete inversion of reality. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To quote M again, &ldquo;I&#39;m writing all this in hopes that she won&#39;t ever do this kind of damage to anyone else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As am I.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And thus concludes my long-winded counterspeech diatribe. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c19">Catharsis?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Gotcha, Gupta. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Regarding the significance of &ldquo;Gupta,&rdquo; it was an idea for an alternate pet name that popped into my head months before the incident. She didn&rsquo;t like it, but after what she did I think I can call her anything I goddamn well please. So I will.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c18 c22 c23">Gotcha, Gupta.</span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c18">Supporting d</span><span class="c21 c18 c22">ocuments </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Notice of Entry of Judgment</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Police report 24-284472</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Declaration of Peter Grace</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Declaration of Matthew Rebello</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incident Calls and Messages Log</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Incident Voicemails</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Text Messages Regarding E</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Amended Declaration of Good Faith Effort</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Email from Fifth District Court Utah</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Letter from Multnomah County Circuit Court Records Clerk</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c10">Post Incident Calls and Messages Log</span></p></body></html>

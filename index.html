  Gyps Amanda Melissa Ruiz (hereinafter, G) and I lived together from March 2023 to November 2024. In August 2024, she went on a trip, and came back broke and unemployed. I paid her rent and bills in September and October. On November 2, she said in several text messages and a voicemail that she gave away some of my stuff. On Monday November 4 when I moved out, the following things were missing:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three of my guitars</li>
  <li>My guitar amp</li>
  <li>My comic book collection</li>
  <li>Two guitar stands</li>
  <li>A collection of about 60 Crown Royal bags, and</li>
  <li>A bag of kitchen utensils</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A week later she denied it. Six weeks after that I found out she slandered me.

  In April 2025, she told someone I know that she sued me in small claims court which is just laughably absurd because it's the easiest to refute.</p>

                        INCIDENTUM 

----------------------->

<hr>
<h2 id="incidentum" class="text-center">Incidentum</h2>

<p>
  A detailed account of the incident  and the events leading up to it can be found in my <a href="docs/declaration-of-peter-grace/">Declaration</a>.
</p>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>
<p>
  I was tired of the roller coaster that our relationship had become (the last straw was when she gaslighted me about giving me money for rent in September 2024), so I contacted an old friend, Leslie. She said she happened to have a room open, and I could move in if I wanted. I told her that I would have to clean the place before I moved in because it was filthy. I came over several times in October to clean. Meanwhile, I was still on the fence about moving out. I wanted to make sure that I was making the right decision for all parties concerned which were G, me, our roommate Adam, and Leslie.
</p>
<p>
  On Saturday November 2, the night of the incident, I went to Leslie’s again to clean. Here’s the timeline:
</p>
<ul class="pad-bottom">
  <li>I arrive at Leslie’s around 7:30 PM and meet her friend Matty for the first time.</li>
  <li>G <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sat-Nov-02-2024-08-26-44">calls me</a> after I arrive. I tell her that I’m going to spend the night at Leslie’s and will be back tomorrow. </li>
  <li>A couple hours later, she <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sat-Nov-02-2024-10-58-43">calls me</a> again and threatens to throw my stuff out. I tell her more than once not to do it. </li>
  <li>I immediately <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sat-Nov-02-2024-11-13-50">call</a> our roommate, Adam. I tell him she’s threatening to throw my stuff out, and ask if he would go to the apartment to make sure she doesn’t.</li>
  <li>Adam sends me a <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sat-Nov-02-2024-11-49-43">text message</a> saying he went there and she wasn’t throwing my stuff out.</li>
  <li>I <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-12-06-24">call</a> the Portland Police Non-Emergency number, and <a href="docs/call-to-non-emergency-dispatch/">explain</a> that my girlfriend is threatening to throw my stuff out.</li>
  <li>She sends me two <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-12-25-00">text messages</a>, one asking if she should remove my belongings from the apartment, and the other stating that someone suggested that she do so.</li>
  <li>An hour and half later, she sends me a <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-01-04-34">text message</a> that reads "Hey, your friend came over and I gave em some of your stuff."</li>
  <li>One minute later, she sends another <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-01-05-06">text message</a> stating that she’d been trying to confirm, but I wouldn’t answer my phone, so she guesses that “it’s all good.”</li>
  <li>She leaves a <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-01-44-19">voicemail</a> where she claims that my friend is there asking for everything. She again admits that she hasn’t received any confirmation from me, but she’s going to give him my stuff anyway.</li>
  <li>She sends another <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-02-03-13">text message</a> stating that because she hasn’t heard from me, she’s not giving anymore of my stuff away. She then says “This entire thing seems shady af”</li>
  <li>Her last <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-02-04-15">text message</a> reads “They say they’re picking it up for you, but you’re not answering my phone calls. So I’m not giving it to them.”</li>
</ul>

<p>I interpreted her last text to mean that she was bluffing and didn’t actually give my stuff away. However, two days later, Monday November 4, when I moved out, the aforementioned belongings were missing.</p>

<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>Legally speaking, one could feasibly assert that by not responding, my silence implied consent. </p> 
<figure class="col-11 mx-auto">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    In tort law, implied consent is a defense to an intentional tort. The plaintiff's consent is implied when the plaintiff fails to object, or is silent in a situation in which a reasonable person would object to the defendant’s action.    
  </blockquote>

    </cite> 
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  However, this is a sham defense by definition, 
</p>

<figure class="col-11 mx-auto">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    A sham plea is good on its face, but false in fact; it may, to all appearances, constitute a perfect defense, but is a pretense because false and because not pleaded in good faith.
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">

  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  And it’s a sham defense for the following reasons. 
</p>
<p>
  One, it’s false in fact because I didn’t send anyone to the apartment to pick up any of my belongings. I stated this in my Declaration which was made under penalty of perjury and which I will repeat here. 
</p>
<figure class="mx-auto col-11">
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    I did not communicate with anyone via any medium at any time that night or that day or prior to that night or that day for the purpose of sending someone to the apartment to pick up any of my belongings.
  </blockquote>

<p>
  The following evidence corroborates this: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Matty's witness <a href="docs/declaration-of-peter-grace/exhibit-6_declaration-of-matthew-rebello/">testimony</a> 
  </li>
  <li>
      My <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html">call and text message history</a> of that weekend
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Two, it was not made in good faith, because several hours before she claimed that she gave away some of my stuff to my “friend”: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>She expressed her intent to remove my belongings from the apartment;</li>
  <li>She said that someone suggested that she do so; and</li>
  <li>I told her more than once over the phone not to do it. </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The following evidence corroborates this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>    
      Matty's witness <a href="docs/declaration-of-peter-grace/exhibit-6_declaration-of-matthew-rebello/">testimony</a>
  </li>
  <li>
      My <a href="docs/call-to-non-emergency-dispatch/">call</a> to Non-Emergency dispatch
    </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sat-Nov-02-2024-11-49-43">text message</a> from our roommate, Adam
  </li>
  <li>
      Her own text messages from that night
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Furthermore, her own language in her text messages and voicemail on the night of the incident is unequivocal regarding who did what. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Hey, your friend came over and I gave em some of your stuff.” </li>
  <li>“Am I supposed to give him this stuff” </li>
  <li>“Do I have to give your friend everything?” </li>
  <li>“You’re not answering So I’m not giving anymore of your stuff until you do.”</li>
  <li>“They say they’re picking it up for you, but you’re not answering my phone calls. So I’m not giving it to them.”</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It’s clear that she was the actor, and the one responsible for giving my stuff away. At no point did she say “Your friend came over and took your stuff,” or anything substantially equivalent. Nor did she use any language indicating that they barged in, broke in, climbed in through the window, or otherwise entered forcibly. Even the phrase “they’re picking it up for you” implies a handing over and acceptance, rather than an appropriation. 
</p>
<p>
  In a criminal case, the standard of proof is “beyond a reasonable doubt;” whereas in a civil case, which includes small claims, the standard of proof is “by the preponderance of evidence.” Or, as a lawyer told me, it’s more likely than not that the defendant did what the plaintiff alleges.
</p>
<p>
  I think that any reasonable person would conclude that by the preponderance of evidence, it’s far more likely than not that she gave away my stuff as she already stated she did.   
</p>
<p>
  Facts aside, even if I intended on moving out that weekend which I didn’t, and I sent people to the apartment to pick up some of my stuff which I didn’t, I would have let her know. I would have told her who it was, when they were going to be there, and what they were going to pick up, because that would have been the considerate and reasonable thing to do.
</p>
<p>
  Also, if I sent people to the apartment to pick up some of my stuff, it would have been for the purpose of them bringing it to me in which case I would still be in possession of my belongings and would have had no reason to sue her in small claims court.
</p>
<p>
  And, if I sent people to the apartment to pick up some of my stuff, then there would likely be a record of this in my call and text message history of that night. However there’s no record of this because it never happened. She or anyone else can subpoena Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, Slack, Reverbnation, Metal-Archives, Discogs, Telegram, LinkedIn, X, MySpace, Friendster, or f***ing AOL and discover the same thing.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, if I were in her position and some complete strangers showed up at the apartment claiming that they were her friends and were there to pick up some of her stuff, I would have contacted her to confirm. If I couldn’t get a hold of her, I would have told the people to get her on the phone so that I could confirm with her myself. If they were unwilling or unable to do that, I would have said “Nope. Not happening,” and shut the door in their faces. I don’t care how rocky our relationship was at the time, I wouldn’t let complete strangers who show up in the middle of the night claiming to be her friends into the apartment to take her belongings without any confirmation from her.

                            POST INCIDENTUM 

--------------------------->

<hr>
<h2 id="post-incidentum" class="text-center">Post Incidentum</h2>

<p>
  She <a href="docs/post-incident-calls-and-messages.html#Fri-Dec-27-2024-10-09-10">called</a> me on Friday December 27 2024. The only reason I answered was because I thought she might be calling to apologize for slandering me and calling me a psycho ten days prior.
</p> 
<p>
  I was wrong.
</p>
<h5>The Context</h5>
<p>
  On Sunday November 3, the day after the incident, I came to the apartment to pick up some essentials so I could get through my work week and move out the following weekend. She showed up while I was packing. She told me to leave and come back tomorrow when she was at work, and tried to push me out of the bedroom. I got tired of her attitude, so I asked her if I could trust her to leave my stuff undisturbed until the next day when I could move out. I had to ask her twice before she agreed. Matty <a href="docs/declaration-of-peter-grace/exhibit-6_declaration-of-matthew-rebello/">witnessed</a> the whole interaction.
</p>
<p>
  Later that night at 11:23 PM when I was back at Leslie’s, she <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html#Sun-Nov-03-2024-11-23-07">called</a> and said she was going to put all my stuff on the porch and that I should come and get it. I told her not to do it, and reminded her that she said I could trust her to leave my things undisturbed until the next day. She said she was going to do it anyway. I told her she was being completely unreasonable. She said “No, <em>you’re</em> being unreasonable!” Leslie and Matty convinced me that she probably just wanted me to come back to the apartment, and wasn’t actually going to throw my stuff out. She called me ten times after that. I ignored every call.
</p>
<p>
  The next day, Monday November 4, when I came to the apartment to move out&mdash;aside from my aforementioned belongings that were missing&mdash;a duffel bag of my clothes was on the porch, and a bunch of my things were stacked up in the living room including the rest of my clothes which were in two hampers. 
</p>
<p>
  Over the following month while I was getting settled in at Leslie’s, I discovered some of her belongings mixed in with mine. I considered throwing it away, but I didn’t want to give her any excuse to accuse me of stealing her stuff, so I made several trips to return it.
</p>
<h5>The First Trip </h5>
<p>
  Friday November 15, I returned a dress and some other things to the porch of the apartment and then went to work. Afterward, she sent me a <a href="docs/post-incident-calls-and-messages.html#Fri-Nov-15-2024-01-33-11">text message</a> saying that the dress wasn’t hers, to give it back to my friend, and that she asked for her pants back. I <a href="docs/post-incident-calls-and-messages.html#text message">told her</a> that I wanted my guitars and my comic books back. She <a href="docs/post-incident-calls-and-messages.html#Fri-Nov-15-2024-01-39-44">told me</a> to ask my “friends” and to tell them that she wants her shit back, too. 
</p>
<h5>The Second Trip</h5>
<p>
  On Sunday December 1, I came to the apartment to drop off the key, to return another one of her shirts, and to make a final attempt to look for my bag of kitchen utensils. I couldn't find them but while I was looking I found a mass of black clothes in the back of a kitchen cabinet. When I pulled it out I discovered that in it were two of my favorite shirts. Baffled but somehow not surprised, I just stuffed them in my backpack. On my way out, she came out of the bedroom. I presented her shirt to her, set it on a chair, and then left. When I got home, I dumped out my backpack and discovered that in addition to my shirts there was also a pair of her pants. 
</p>
<h5>The Third Trip</h5>
<p>
  Friday December 6, I returned her pants to the porch of the apartment along with a few other things that I discovered in the intervening week. After I left, I sent her a <a href="docs/post-incident-calls-and-messages.html#Fri-Dec-06-2024-01-29-31">text</a> that said “I found your pants. They were next to two of my shirts in a kitchen cabinet. You had them the whole time.” She didn’t respond. 
</p>
<p>
  Altogether, I returned the following things of hers: 
  <ul>
    <li>a pair of her pants, </li>
    <li>a dress, </li>
    <li>two shirts, </li>
    <li>a CD, </li>
    <li>a Discman, </li>
    <li>a poster, </li>
    <li>a book, </li>
    <li>and a beer koozie.</li>
  </ul>
   
</p>
<p>And that was that. Or so I thought…</p>

<h5>The Slander</h5>
<p>
  On Tuesday December 17, I went to the bar by our former apartment. The bartender whom I’ve known for several years prior to G and who befriended G while we were together told me that G said that I ripped her off, that I was on meth, and that I came to the apartment one night to steal more of her stuff but she was home so I left.
</p>
<p>
  I was dumbfounded. 
</p>
<p>
  After the bartender informed me of G’s slander, I went to the bathroom. When I came out of the bathroom, G’s coke dealer was sitting at the bar a few stools down from mine. A few moments later, G appeared from the bathroom and stood next to him. In an attempt to defuse the awkwardness, the bartender said to G “Why don’t you two go on the patio and work it out?” G responded “I don’t want to talk to that psycho!” I just laughed and left shortly thereafter.
</p>
<h5>The Irony</h5>
<p>
  She hides two of my shirts in a kitchen cabinet along with a pair of her own pants that she later claims she wants back. I make three trips to return all of her belongings despite the fact that she gave away a bunch of mine. Then she turns around and tells somebody I know that I ripped her off and I’m on meth and then shows up at the bar with her coke dealer. 
</p>
<p>
  And then she calls <strong>me</strong> a psycho?
</p>
<h5>The Pretense </h5>
<p>
  Ten days later, on Friday December 27, she <a href="docs/post-incident-calls-and-messages.html#Fri-Dec-27-2024-10-09-10">called</a> me at 10:09 PM.
</p>
<p>
  She said that someone told her I wasn’t doing well and that she should check on me. I asked her who told her that. She said “I don't want to give up their name.“
</p>
<p>
  I said “I just want my stuff back.” She said “So do I!”
</p>
<p>
  I reminded her that she already admitted giving my stuff away in several text messages and a voicemail. She denied admitting it. I told her that her text messages are part of a police report. She said she filed a police report, too.
</p>
<p>
  She mentioned that she wanted her pants back. I told her I already gave her pants back to her. She said she was talking about her “other” pants. 
</p>
<p>
  I reminded her that I found her pants next to two of my shirts in a kitchen cabinet. She said she didn’t know how they got there. I said “You packed my clothes.” She said “No, I didn’t!” I said “Then who did?” She said “I don’t know!”
</p>
<p>
  The last thing I said to her was “You’re a liar. Don’t talk to me anymore,” and then hung up on her. 
</p>

<p>
  She immediately called me back twice. I didn’t answer. Then she sent me a series of <a href="docs/post-incident-calls-and-messages.html#Fri-Dec-27-2024-10-16-56">text messages</a> which, again, perfectly exemplifies her disingenuous behavior.
</p>
<p class="font-monospace bg-primary rounded-4 p-2 col-10 ms-auto border border-primary-subtle">
  The only reason I called you was because someone said that you weren't well and asked me to check in on you
</p>
<p class="font-monospace bg-primary rounded-4 p-2 col-10 ms-auto border border-primary-subtle">
  Also, I guess I can tell you that your police report is considered fraud because my job was able to prove that I was at work when you called
</p>
<p class="font-monospace bg-primary rounded-4 p-2 col-10 ms-auto border border-primary-subtle">
  Just letting you know. Give me back my shit, please, thank you, go fuck yourself.

  I asked her what the case number of her police report is, and she responded:
</p>
<p class="font-monospace bg-primary rounded-4 p-2 col-10 ms-auto border border-primary-subtle">
  69420. Go fuck yourself
</p>
<p class="font-monospace bg-primary rounded-4 p-2 col-10 ms-auto border border-primary-subtle">
  I had to search for the info so you can do it yourself
</p>
<p class="font-monospace bg-primary rounded-4 p-2 col-10 ms-auto  border border-primary-subtle">
  Also, you were on speaker phone..... with my lawyer

<h5>The Absurdity</h5>
<p></p>
<p class="col-10">
  My police report is considered fraud? Seems a little hypocritical considering that she didn’t even file one herself.
  Also, <a href="docs/incident-calls-and-messages.html">my call history</a> of the night of the incident clearly shows that I didn’t call her once, whereas she called me multiple times. And the issue is not where she was when I allegedly called her. The issue is that she said she gave away some of my stuff and two days later a bunch of my stuff was missing.  
</p>
<p class="col-10">
  Give her back her shit? I already did. On multiple trips. And why would she call me to check on my well-being, then tell me to go fuck myself? Rude. 
</p>
<p class="col-10">
  Her case number is 69-420? Sounds fishy. And again, rude.
</p>
<p class="col-10">
  What info did she have to search for? You can’t just google police reports. You have to submit a public records request with the PPB Records Division which is what I did. That’s how I found out she didn’t file a police report. 
</p>
<p>
  If the <strong>only</strong> reason she called me was to check on my well-being, then why was I on speaker phone with her “lawyer/paralegal?” And which was it, a lawyer or a paralegal? In any case, who talks to their lawyer at 10:00 PM on a Friday night? Also, it’s been nearly eight months as of this writing and I still haven’t received any letter from a lawyer, paralegal, law firm, or paralegal service.
</p>
<p>
  At the very least, it’s nice to know that she genuinely cares about my well-being.
</p>

<p>
  After the incident and her subsequent slander, it occurred to me that if she did that to me, she may have done something similar to her ex (hereinafter “E”) and fled Utah to escape accountability. To satisfy my morbid curiosity, I contacted one of his family members&mdash;a cousin who I will refer to as M. She said they were very close, and proceeded to tell me a completely different story than the one G related to me. She didn't give me permission to publish our email exchange, so I'll summarize it here.
</p>
<p> But first… </p>
<h5>My Recollection of G’s Version</h5>
<p>
  They met at the Slabtown New Seasons as co-workers. She was staying on the couch with some old creepy guy who tried to put the moves on her. She ended up moving in with E. They became romantically involved. After some time, they decided to move to Springdale, Utah where he was from. He moved there first to get settled and line up a job for both of them. She followed several months later. They worked at a brewery near Zion National Park. She enjoyed working there, but he drank a lot, got fired, and she had to support both of them. His drinking continued, and he became abusive. One night, he threw a burrito at her while she was lying in bed. Finally one night, he left the house with a friend to go out drinking, and she used the opportunity to quickly pack up and leave. She took the car and headed back to Portland. She ran out of gas along the way, and had to ask someone to send her money. When she got to Portland, she stayed on a female friend's couch somewhere on Interstate Ave. She got hired at the Alibi soon after. E tracked her down from Utah and confronted her on the patio of the Alibi. She told her co-workers (and me) that her abusive ex-boyfriend was stalking her and she had a restraining order against him in Utah. She told me afterwards that he must have put a tracking app on her phone while they were still in Utah.
</p>
<p>
  An unfortunate story, and one that would make anyone sympathize with her.
</p>
<p> And now… </p>
<h5>My Summary of M's version</h5>
<p>
  They met at New Seasons. He had just gotten out of rehab a month prior. She complained about her bad roommate situation: “a stalkery, abusive roommate story.” He offered her a safe place to crash. They became romantically involved, and she never moved out. Her presence caused tension with his roommate. 
</p>
<blockquote class="fst-italic">
  &ldquo;Pretty soon, E---- learned that Gyps' love is the choking kind.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
<p>
  He felt suffocated because they lived together and worked together. He tried changing shifts and changing jobs but she followed him every time. They fought about it, and he began drinking again.
</p>
<p>
  E asked M to take him to rehab while G was at work. When M picked him up he had two black eyes. He didn’t remember what happened but G insisted that he’d deserved it. He hoped she would be gone when he got out, but she was still living there when he did. They reconciled briefly. She convinced him that rehab had been a mistake. Six months later, his sister flew to Portland to take him to medical detox. He changed his phone number so G couldn’t contact him, and they left for Utah.
</p>
<p>
  In Springdale he began "sorting out the mindfuck that Gyps had been." Six months later G showed up at his mom’s house. She ingratiated her way back into his life. E helped her get a job, but she got fired from three places.
</p>
<p class="fst-italic">
  &ldquo;She blamed him & punished him because things weren't going well for her.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  She barricaded herself in the bedroom, and made him sleep on the couch. Their roommates broke up with her on his behalf, and told her she had to move out because “she was making everyone miserable & wasn’t contributing rent.”
</p>
<p>
  He drove her to the Las Vegas airport so she could go to Colorado for a job she had lined up. She came back less than 48 hours later. They tried to stay at one of his aunts in Vegas, but she was recovering from a stroke and the family didn’t want G around her. So, they sold his phone for gas money and drove to Portland. 
</p>
<p>
  She got hired at the Alibi shortly after. Meanwhile, they were living in his car and trying to figure out their next step. 
</p>
<p class="fst-italic">
  &ldquo;He told me that they were both wasted, she was screaming at him and hit him. He snapped and hit her back. She left. At that point, she had drained him of everything – money, relationships, living situations – and she was brutal in the way she dismissed him.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  On April 23 2023, he took his own life.
</p>

<h4>Comparison</h4>
<p>
  Obviously, the two versions are vastly different. But which one is more accurate? 
</p>
<p>
  Some evidence that affects the credibility of G’s version:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>She lied about me ripping her off.</li>
  <li>She lied about suing me in small claims court.</li>
  <li>She lied about filing a police report against me.</li>
  <li>She lied about having a restraining order against her ex.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Some evidence that corroborates M’s version:
</p>
<p class="fst-italic">
  &ldquo;Her presence caused tension with his roommate.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  According to <a href="docs/police-report-20-65764/">this police report</a>, in February 2020, G moved in with E and his roommate. G and the roommate had a physical altercation during an argument about the roommate’s use of their bathroom. Granted, the roommate got arrested for assault, but this happened a mere two weeks after G moved in. 
</p>
<p class="fst-italic">
  &ldquo;She blamed him & punished him because things weren't going well for her.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
  According to <a href="docs/police-report-20-156576/">another police report</a>, in May 2020, the police were called to G and E’s house again for disorderly conduct. When the officer arrived he said he saw “a female climbing off of a male in the living room area.” G told the officer that “she wants her boyfriend out of the house” because “he doesn't work and she just lost her job.” The officer also noticed multiple scratches on E’s neck and shoulders.
</p>
<p class="fst-italic">
  My own experience with G also corroborates M’s version. 
</p>
<p>
  In September 2023, she got fired from the Alibi for drinking on the job. She felt she was wrongfully terminated even though she had been warned and had been on probation for a number of weeks. She criticized me for weeks because I didn’t quit in protest despite the fact that she had only been there for seven months whereas I had been there for five and a half years.
</p>
<p>
  Seems pretty clear which version is more accurate.
</p>

      <!-- CONCLUSIO -->

<hr>
<h2 id="conclusio" class="text-center">Conclusio</h2>
<p>
  Having related all that unflattering information about her, to balance the scales, I should add in all fairness that I AM NOT PERFECT. I experience sub-optimum mental phenomena on a regular basis with its attendant physiological manifestations. In other words, I’ve developed a tick. Some of my co-workers who’ve inadvertently witnessed it probably think I have mental problems. But who doesn’t? I’m organized and conscientious, so fuck ‘em. Also, I have a temper, bad breath, and I fart a lot. Kudos to her for putting up with me.
</p>
<p>
  I will also add that the first seven months G and I were together were amazing. We were madly in love. We spent every day together with few exceptions. She was my best friend. We had a lot of good times and a lot of laughs–even up to the end. 
</p>
<p>
  However, based on what I learned about her since the incident, the woman I fell in love with is not the woman who gave my stuff away. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>That</strong> woman is an abusive, manipulative, vindictive liar.
</p>
<p>
  But that’s just my opinion.

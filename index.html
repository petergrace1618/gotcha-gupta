    <h3>The short version</h3>

    <p>
      My ex-girlfriend ripped me off in November 2024. That's bad enough, but then I found out she had been slandering me after the fact. So I sued her in small claims court and won. By "won" I mean the court entered a default judgement against her because she ignored everything. She probably doesn't even even know that I won, which explains why she's telling people that <strong>SHE</strong> sued <strong>ME</strong> in small claims court&mdash;I recently found out.

      Well, not only is that laughable, it's also easy to refute. Anyone that were so inclined could go the Oregon Judicial Department's Online Records Search at <a href="https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/</a>, click on the <a href="https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/Home/Dashboard/29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Search</a> button, and search for court records by name or case number.

      For example, if someone were to search for one of her many aliases (Gyps Ruiz, Amanda Gyps Ruiz, or Amanda Melissa Ruiz) one would see that there's only one small claims case where she's listed as a party, and that's as a defendant. And if one wanted further corroboration of her untruthfulness, here are all the documents I filed in the case.

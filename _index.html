    <!-- <h3>The short version</h3> -->

    <p>
      On Saturday November 2 2024, my girlfriend at the time said she gave away some of my stuff, and on Monday November 4 2024, when I moved out of our shared apartment, I discovered that some of my most valuable possessions were missing. Namely, three guitars, a guitar amp, my comic book collection, two guitar stands, a collection of Crown Royal bags, and a bag of kitchen utensils. Worth (by my own fair market value estimation) approximately $1200.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if that weren't bad enough, I discovered after the fact that she had been slandering me. So I sued her in small claims court and won. By "won" I mean the court entered a default judgment against her because she ignored everything. She probably doesn't even even know that I won, which explains why she's telling people that <strong>SHE</strong> sued <strong>ME</strong> in small claims court&mdash;I recently found out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, not only is that laughably absurd, it's also easily refutable. Anyone can go to the Oregon Judicial Department's Online Records Search at <a href="https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/</a>, click on the <a href="https://webportal.courts.oregon.gov/portal/Home/Dashboard/29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Search</a> button, type in one of her many aliases (Gyps Ruiz, Amanda Gyps Ruiz, or Amanda Melissa Ruiz), and see that the only small claims case where she's listed as a party is the one that I filed against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or if you're lazy you can just look at all the court documents that I filed which are listed below.
